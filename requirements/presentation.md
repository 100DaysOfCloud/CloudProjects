# Architectual Diagrams

## What is an architectual diagram?

An architectual diagram in the context of cloud is a visual representation of cloud services interconnected with other cloud services that make up a cloud workload.

## What is the point of an architectual diagram?

An architectual diagram is used to quickly communicate a proposed or an existing cloud workload and its accompanying infrastructure to other team members or stakeholders.


## Why do I need to create an architectual diagram for my cloud project?

Creating Architectual diagrams is a fundemental skill for any cloud role and during the interview process it is very common to be asked to draw an architectual diagram on a whiteboard to showcase or describe a cloud workload.

## The C4 Model

C4 Model is a lean graphical notation technique for modelling the architecture of software systems.

C4 Model is not specific to cloud architectual diagrams but is appicable to any software systems including cloud workloads.

C4 Model will help you understand what information is important to capture and what should be left out in your architectual diagrams.
